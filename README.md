# Grid Playground React App

## General Info

This project is a simple React Single Page Application.

Its purpose is to present the main features of the CSS Grid property.
It also provides a handy playground to experiment with these features by using different pages and layouts.

The project explores the properties of the grid container as well as its grid items.

The Home page shows a visual comparison of grid and flexbox, as well as a simplified view of the basic components of the grid.

The Layout page presents a classic responsive grid layout of an entire page with header, sidebar, main content and footer. The scss file demonstrates that this can be achieved with grid lines or grid areas.

The Articles page shows a more complicated responsive grid design and gives an even better comparison between the grid lines and the grid areas approach.

The Cards pages uses grid on different levels - for the layout of the entire page, for the cards container and for each single card as well. Its main purpose is to explore the implicit grid properties and how they can simplify the responsive design.

The Positions page provides a playground for testing the justify and align grid properties of the container and of the grid items. This page is not responsive.
